            <h2>Founding and Early Years</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1912 by Andrew Jackson Smitherman, an African American lawyer, journalist, and civil rights activist, The Tulsa Star quickly became a significant voice for Tulsa’s African American community. Smitherman had previously established the Muskogee Star in Muskogee, Oklahoma. He was the second of eleven children, and his family moved to Indian Territory during his childhood. He pursued higher education at the University of Kansas and Northwestern University, earning a law degree from La Salle University Extension School.</p>
            <p>Smitherman's passion for journalism led him to work at William Twine's Muskogee Cimeter in 1908. In 1913, he saw new opportunities in Tulsa and relocated his newspaper, renaming it The Tulsa Star. Unlike many African American newspapers that leaned toward Republican ideals, The Tulsa Star promoted Democratic principles. (Gateway.okhistory.org)</p>

            <h2>Role in the Greenwood Community</h2>
            <p>The Tulsa Star served as a platform for Smitherman to disseminate his Democratic ideals at a time when Republican views were more predominant in Black communities. He encouraged African Americans to exercise their legal rights and remain persistent in their pursuit of justice. Smitherman was a strong advocate for self-defense and often urged the community to safeguard itself against racial violence. (okhistory.org)</p>
            <p>Beyond journalism, Smitherman was deeply involved in civic affairs. In 1919, Governor James B.A. Robertson recognized his leadership by selecting him as a delegate to welcome President Woodrow Wilson to Oklahoma. (gateway.okhistory.org) In 1920, following a series of lynchings, Smitherman was invited to participate in an interracial conference organized by Governor Robertson, aiming to address and reduce racial tensions in the state.

            <h2>Impact of the Tulsa Race Massacre</h2>
            <p>Andrew Jackson Smitherman played a pivotal role in Tulsa’s African American community during the early 20th century. The Tulsa Star was headquartered in the Greenwood District, famously known as “Black Wall Street” due to its thriving Black-owned businesses. The newspaper regularly informed African Americans about their legal rights and provided updates on court rulings and legislation affecting them and their community.</p>
            <p>During the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, The Tulsa Star’s offices were destroyed, silencing a crucial voice for the Black community. In the aftermath, Smitherman was among 60 Black residents indicted for riot-related offenses. Facing these charges, he fled Tulsa and settled in Buffalo, New York, where he continued his journalism career by founding the Buffalo Star in 1932. Smitherman's unwavering commitment to justice and equality laid the groundwork for future generations. (okhistory.org, uncrowdedcommunitybuilders.com, gateway.okhistory.org)</p>
